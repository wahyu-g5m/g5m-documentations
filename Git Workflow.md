1. Aware of what git workflow is supposed to do and to avoid unnecessary conflict between your work and other programmer’s work:
	-  If you want to updating some code, **make sure** your update doesn’t conflicted with any other programmer
	-  If you want to modify some scene or asset, **make sure** your modified scene or asset are not currently in the work of any other programmer
	- If you want to import some asset, **make sure** the asset haven’t been imported or the other programmer isn’t currently importing it into unity
	- If you want to create new script or unity asset file, **make sure** your script or asset file name isn’t the same as what the other programmer is creating
2. **Don’t forget** to fetch the Git, to keep you up to date in the Git workflow
3. If you need some feature or work done by other programmer, you can merge the corresponding branch
4. Commit your work through the Git client using your own branch, write commit message as simple as you can, short description to what have you been working on

5. If your branch is good to go, push it, and create a pull request. The pull request is requesting your branch to be pulled to the lead/senior programmer branch, Set the corresponding branch owner as the reviewer of that pull request
6. (Optional) inform the target branch owner after submitting the pull request
