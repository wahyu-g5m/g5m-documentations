# About Obsidian
Obsidian is an app mainly used for taking notes.
It uses Markdown language for editing and produce a file with **.md** extension which can be opened by any Markdown editor, making the notes is not tightly coupled to Obsidian.

see Obsidian on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)) for more.

# Editing
## Basic Editing
Basic editing (bold, italic, heading, list, etc) is provided by the editing-toolbar plugin above
for more markdown editing, refer to this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
## Backlink
For tags we use backlinks (to make the Graph View easier to navigate)
`[[backlink]]`

## How to Make Documentation
- Make a clear short title
- Do not put file in a folder. Here we use [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/) method where every note is a free note linked by merely tags for relationship between notes
- Tag notes are empty notes. Its purpose is just for tagging. This method makes notes connection is easier to grasp when viewing the Graph View
- Use document template and fill the tags using backlink
